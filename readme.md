## Phase 1: Core Foundation (Get Something Flying!)

### Project Setup
- [x] Create a new project directory.
- [x] Initialize a Git repository.
- [x] Initialize pnpm (`pnpm init`).
- [x] Create `index.html`, `css/style.css`, and `js/app.js` files.
- [x] Install Three.js (`pnpm add three`).
- [x] Include Three.js in `index.html` (via `node_modules` or a bundler).

### Basic 3D Scene
- [x] Initialize a Three.js scene, camera, and renderer in `app.js`.
- [x] Set the renderer size to fill the browser window.
- [x] Add a simple object (e.g., `THREE.BoxGeometry` or `THREE.SphereGeometry`).
- [x] Implement a basic animation loop.
- [x] Verify that the object is rotating or moving.

### Basic Aircraft Model
- [x] Create Aircraft model with three.js.
- [x] Load the aircraft model into the scene.
- [x] Position and scale the aircraft appropriately.

### Camera Control (Basic)
- [ ] Attach the camera to the aircraft.
- [ ] Implement basic camera movement using WASD keys.
- [ ] Implement basic pitch and roll control (rotate the camera).

### Basic Flight Dynamics (Simplified)
- [ ] Introduce variables for aircraft speed, altitude, and orientation.
- [ ] Implement throttle control (increase/decrease speed).
- [ ] Implement pitch, roll, and yaw control using keyboard input.
- [ ] Update the aircraft's position and orientation.

### Basic Terrain (Simple Plane)
- [ ] Create a large `THREE.PlaneGeometry` to represent the ground.
- [ ] Apply a simple texture (e.g., grass texture).
- [ ] Position the aircraft above the ground.

### Basic UI (HUD)
- [ ] Add an HTML element to display aircraft speed and altitude.
- [ ] Update these values in the animation loop.

## Phase 2: Improving Realism and Control

### Refined Flight Dynamics
- [ ] Introduce lift, drag, and gravity forces.
- [ ] Implement a more realistic flight model.
- [ ] Implement stall behavior.
- [ ] Add a basic autopilot (optional).

### Improved Camera Control
- [ ] Implement a chase camera that follows the aircraft.
- [ ] Allow switching between different camera views (cockpit, chase, etc.).

### More Detailed Terrain (Heightmap)
- [ ] Find or create a heightmap image.
- [ ] Generate a 3D terrain mesh from the heightmap.
- [ ] Apply textures to the terrain.

### Lighting and Shadows
- [ ] Add directional lighting.
- [ ] Enable shadows.

### UI Improvements
- [ ] Add more gauges and indicators (heading, vertical speed, etc.).
- [ ] Improve the UI's visual design.

### Control Mapping
- [ ] Allow customization of keyboard controls.
- [ ] Implement joystick/gamepad support using the Web Gamepad API.

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Optional)

### Weather Simulation
- [ ] Implement wind effects on the aircraft.
- [ ] Add rain or snow effects.
- [ ] Simulate turbulence.

### AI Traffic
- [ ] Add AI-controlled aircraft.
- [ ] Implement basic AI flight behavior.

### Navigation Systems
- [ ] Implement a GPS system.
- [ ] Implement VOR navigation.

### Scenery Generation
- [ ] Use procedural generation for realistic scenery.

### Networking (Multiplayer)
- [ ] Implement multiplayer support using WebSockets or WebRTC.
